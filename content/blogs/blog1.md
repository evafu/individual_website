title: My experience in Finance
---
When I was a year-one student, in ICBC, my first job in finance, I have successfully promoted financial product earning more than 1 million profits within 5 days! After that, during my undergraduate, I approached different roles in financial industry, as equity researcher and private fund investor. I gained much TMT industry exposure through approaching industry experts and executives.

Later, I realized that instead of only care about whether invest or not, I’m curious more about the deal process. Then I switched to act as an IB intern in China security, where I spent seven-month full but happy period. I participated in two IPO deals focused on TMT industry. I have predicted financial performance, finalized presentation, and successfully pitched for a 0.4 bn CNY investment for clients. Also, I have been proactively learning different businesses, and building up valuation skills.

**I'm currently studying MFA in LBS and seeking internships in IB in both HK and London. I summerized my working experience below.**
