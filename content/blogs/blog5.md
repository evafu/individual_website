**"I love sunny days, and love to record my life by photos."_**

My name is Eva, I was born in mainland China before I move to HK for university, now I'm reading MFA at London Business School. I grew up in Harbin, northeast of China. I specialised in Finance & Economics in HKBU and Business Communication in University of Victoria (Canada). I have accumulated work experience in finance as a banker, sell-side equity researcher and buy-side investor.

Inherited the extroverted character of northeast people, I’m keen on talking with different people. I’m keen on participating into charity work and seeking opportunity to contribute impact on society. I have been to Nepal for a Women Empowerment Programme, in which we provided technical support in handicraft, assistance in sales and imparted survival skills to local illiterate women. I have been elected as Student Representative to lead a charity project with 5000+ participants. The project aims to prosper endangered Camellia Industry in Southern Jiangxi Region, China. We upgraded traditional production line through seeking cost reduction method from Prof. Ruan (reduce cost by 40%), extended their market channel to e-commerce with 5000+monthly sales, redefined the market segment after researching, and eventually sought 60 million CNY external finance from 30+ society investors. 


Outside the school and working place, I really love snow weather! I love photography, traveling. I can play piano and various Chinese instruments. I love the feeling in sky when paragliding. And I'm ready for my next challenge to embark on a new journey. I’m now seeking a place for horse riding and paragliding. 

If you have same interest with me, or if you want to know more about my academic, working or even charity work, do not hesitate to contact me!
